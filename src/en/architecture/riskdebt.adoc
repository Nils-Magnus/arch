.No unittest coverage for customizings
The customizing team has not managed to implement unittests accompanying their development.
Consequences are:

- the reduction to blackbox testing (= clicktests from outside the system) only give no picture
  about the base quality of the delivered changes

- many rainy day scenarios with separate codepathes are completely untested

- there are no automated unit testsuite (whitebox) with relevant code coverage for user interface
  and client customisation parts. (Some business logic parts have as a role model.)

- There is no Continuous Integration Pipeline that forces code formatting, linting and automated testing
  for newly produced code and ensures a quality baseline.


_Recommendation: This shortcoming has been addressed regularly from architecture, but no progress yet.
Frontend/client development still fully relies on high-level blackbox testing (Selenium and manual).
It is urgently recommended that the project or the following application management is catching up with
the whitebox testing shortcoming to reach the goal of release-robustness._
