// == Principles catalog

#There are a lot of guidelines set during the implementation of the architecture that guide
what to do and what not. A list of these principles is usually not available.
We improve this by gathering all principles here, as well as tag and xref them.
You can either include the principle by word at your current text position
by `include::../principles.adoc[tags=p_tagname]` or reference it
by `\xref:#p_tagname[]`# 


[[ref_12factor, 12-factor app]] 
// tag::p_12factor[]
12-factor app::
    The cloud design follows the principles of a https://12factor.net[12-factor app].
// end::p_12factor[]

[[ref_agnosticimg, Stage-agnostic images]] 
// tag::p_agnosticimg[]
Stage-agnostic images::
    (Server) images are environment-agnostic. They are packed once and used unchanged in all environments along the
    staging chain.
// end::p_agnosticimg[]

[TIP]
.#Steer with principles#
#If a concept sticks to a principle, you can either put a "copy by word" or a reference in the text as in the following examples#

(Example)We stick to xref:#ref_12factor[] and introduce the following new principle:

include::principles.adoc[tags=p_agnosticimg]
