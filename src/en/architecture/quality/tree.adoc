#The quality part of the architecture documentation is based on ATAM Quality scenarios and the
https://iso25000.com/index.php/en/iso-25000-standards/iso-25010[ISO25010 Software Product Quality Model]#

#A *quality tree* structures the ATAM scenarios that apply for the architecture according to the
Software Product Quality model. The detailed scenarios are documented then in detail in the 
following chapters. See Arc42 about https://docs.arc42.org/tips/10-4/[usage of a quality tree] and 
https://docs.arc42.org/tips/1-12/[structure of ATAM scenarios]#

#Don't nest the chapters too deep as it will confuse the reader. We recommend to document all scenarios on document
section level 3 and show deeper nested dependencies only in overview tree graph.#
