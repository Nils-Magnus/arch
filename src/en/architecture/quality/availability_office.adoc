==== Availability during office hours
The system is always available during office hours (weekdays, 7:00h - 20:00h CET).
Non-catastrophic, unexpected outages should be fixed within 1 hour.


.Observations & metrics
* External health checkers:
  System is inavailable if 80% of the calls drop below the benchmark values. 


.Quality measures
* Major upgrades that require a downtime are planned for non-office hours.

* Loadbalancer replaces nodes on unexpected node outage.

* There is way to guarantee a solution for every unexpected, non-catastrophic outage within an hour.
  Thus, the incident process is organized so that in general, a fix within one our is the average standard
  with an early pre-warning for the case of delay.

* External health checkers check primary use cases every 5 minutes (see Section ...)
  for early alarming on outage.
