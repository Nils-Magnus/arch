#The logical building blocks are best described in a hierarchical manner, aka.
https://docs.arc42.org/section-5/[blackbox/whitebox] approach, see Arc42 
https://docs.arc42.org/section-5/.#

=== Business Capabilities
#(example)#

image::capabilities_en.drawio.svg[Capabilities view]

[vertical]
Business Capability PartnerSelection::
The IT systems are capable of handling applications and evaluations of partners.
The responsibility extends to caring of the customers until final dissolving of
partnership.
Business Function PartnerCare:::
The IT systems for buying organisation handle the complete lifecycle of the
partner relationship apart from the technological fit.
Business Function PartnerAssessment:::
The IT systems realizing this function contain procedures and benchmarks to assess
efficiency and effectiveness of partners. Partnering requires mandatory a positive
assessment fro production.
Business Capability SolutionDelivery::
The capability subsumes all tools and procedures for tracking solution delivery in
time and budget.


[TIP]
====
People tend to use the term "Management" excessively when describing capabilities. The difficulty with this
term is that it does not reflect well what the business domain really does. For example, in Tennis sports,
you talk about "ForehandShot" as capability and not "YellowballOpenhandManagement" We recommend to avoid 
"Management" term whenever possible. A good naming convention is `<Forehand=Object><Shot=Action verb as substantivation>`

=== Services
#(example, blackbox)#

#The service view shows the covered business capabilities and the mapping to services.
It is strongly based on Domain-driven design concepts.#
#(example)#

image::services_en.drawio.svg[Domains-Services view]

#Shortly describe your services and what they deliver "at the edge" of the business domain they live in.
The choice of structure depends on the ubiquitous language of the solution context. Choose short but
precise statements that seduce the reader to dig deeper into the document and to learn more.#

.#Blackbox view metaphore# 
#Imagine you describe a car by its outside look and capabilities you request from your car.

==== Service PartnerCare 
#(example, 1st level whitebox)#

#Each following section strongly resembles the way "building architects" make detail construction sketches. Also feel
free to add other views on the logical parts of your design like process flows, sequence diagrams.#

.#Whitebox view metaphore#
#Imagine you want to understand better what makes your car driving and you open the front trunk
of your car with the motor. You can now see the basic parts a motor is composed of, but some parts are still blackbox
and need deeper deconstruction. This leads to different levels of detail on deconstruction.#

#The further format is left to the reader. Again, choose wisely to describe stable building blocks your stakeholder
can understand. Prefer stable blueprints over coding details that may change over time!#

.#Steer with principles#
#If a concept sticks to a principle, you can either put a "copy by word" or a reference in the text as in the following
examples#

We stick to xref:#ref_12factor[] and introduce the following new principle:
