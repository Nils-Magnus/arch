=== Installation/orchestration

#There are many ways to describe the installed software stack. Arc42 recommends UML deployment diagrams,
but a simple table with versions numbers can also do. In times of containers, the ultimate truth is
located in the container descriptions (`Dockerfile`). Again, as brittle information, it is recommended
to avoid brittle information in concept and better refer to the ultimate truth on your automation repo.#

#If it is not possible to avoid a conceptual summary of the installed software, inclusion of `Dockerfile` code
or generative extraction by AsciiDoc scripting is an option. Also, the use of tools that compute all (OpenSource)
dependencies could be helpful to avoid manual work.#
