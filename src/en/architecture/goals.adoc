=== Architecture quality goals

.Efficient scaling(example) [[ref_goal_scaling, efficient scaling]]
The system should automatically scale up/down depending on user traffic (or migration traffic) and avoid resource waste ("no idle infrastructure"). This is mandatory to reach break-even and is more sustainable, of course.


.Minimal run efforts(example) [[ref_goal_run, minimal run efforts]]
Deployment and run mechanisms are automated so that lifecycle management of the application gets regular business. Server-side security patches are rolled out potentially every week, patches and minor releases donÂ´t need downtimes. New major releases including new features in all client apps are planned 4 times a year and should follow base product lifecycle. Client apps are patched and published on demand.
