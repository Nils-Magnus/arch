== Constraints

.Efficient scaling(example) [[ref_goal_scaling, efficient scaling]]
The system should automatically scale up/down depending on user traffic (or migration traffic) and avoid resource waste 
("no idle infrastructure"). This is mandatory to fulfil the commercial goals of the re-purchase. 

.Minimal run efforts(example) [[ref_goal_run, minimal run efforts]]
Deployment and run mechanisms are automated so that lifecycle management of the application gets regular business.
Server-side security patches are rolled out potentially every week, patches and minor releases donÂ´t need downtimes.
